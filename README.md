## Installation

Create your copy of Underskeleton and name it to your taste at [getunderskeleton.com/download](https://getunderskeleton.com/download), copy from [latest release](https://github.com/diegoversiani/underskeleton/releases). Then:

- Login to your WordPress backend
- Go to Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme
- Select your theme file → Install Now
- Activate the theme


#### Manual Installation

- Download Underskeleton zip file from GitHub
- Extract files and change the folder name from `underskeleton-master` to `underskeleton` (or one of your choice)
- Upload it into your WordPress themes subfolder: `/wp-content/themes/`
- Login to your WordPress backend
- Go to Appearance → Themes

##### Changing theme identification

To change Underskeleton theme identification to your own you need to replace any 'underskeleton' text with your theme id and, optionally, replace the theme name as well.

- Open the project in the editor of your choice (i.e [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/))
- Replace all 'underskeleton' matches with 'your_theme_id' (**case sensitive**) ([screenshot](https://getunderskeleton.com/images/replace_all_id.png))
- Optionally, replace all 'Underskeleton' matches with 'Your Theme Name' (**case sensitive**) ([screenshot](https://getunderskeleton.com/images/replace_all_name.png))
- That is it.

## Folder structure

Most of the folder structure is inherited from _s. Its files are well documented, have a look ;)

Bellow are just Underskeleton's file structure

```
underskeleton/
  └── css                            
    └── theme.css         // Theme styles, Skeleton and Underskeleton stuff, include your styles 
    └── theme.min.css     // Minified version of theme styles, this is the file served to the browser. 
  └── js
    └── assets            // Folder for assets from other projects, ie _s.
    └── *.js              // Uncompiled underskeleton scripts
  └── sass
    └── theme             // Uncompiled Sass files for your theme
    └── theme.scss        // Uncompiled theme scss files that basically @imports all other scss files
  └── style.css           // WordPress theme identification file
  ...
```

## Developer Tools

Underskeleton is developed with NPM, Bower, Gulp, SASS, Browser Sync and Css Autoprefixer. You can develop without these tools, but its just a lot faster with them ;)

#### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed `Node.js`, `Bower`, and `Browser-Sync` on your computer globally. To install Bower and Browser-Sync, run*:
```
# May require root/administrator permissions

$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g browser-sync
```
- Open your terminal and browse to the location of your Underskeleton copy
- Run these comands:
```
# install node.js packages, install bower dependencies, copy assets to source folder

$ npm install
$ bower install
```

#### Running
To work and compile your SASS and JS files on the fly, run:

`$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in `/gulpfile.js` file in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
var browserSyncOptions = {
    proxy: "localhost/underskeleton/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
    notify: false
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

If you just want to build once:

`$ gulp build-css` or
`$ gulp build-scripts`
